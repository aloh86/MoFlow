#MoFlow Initiative Tracker


##What is MoFlow
MoFlow is an initiative tracker for d20 based initiative for Dungeons & Dragons games.

##Features
* Create Player Character and Encounter groups that can easily be inserted into initiative.
* Creature Catalog
	* Create and save your own custom creatures
	* Load a prebuilt library of creatures from certain editions of D&D.
	* Support for hit die expressions.
* Initiative Tracker
	* Load presaved groups, or from the creature catalog, or from scratch.
	* Auto roll or manually assign.
	* Sort ascending or descending.
	* Initiative bonuses are already added.
	* Easily keep track of hit points.
	* Optionally view ability scores for items in initiative.
	* Creatures with a hit die expression are automatically rolled hit points.

##Requested Features
The following is a list of requested features that have yet to be implemented.

* Dropbox Support
	* Be able to import and export the current state of the creature catalog from a Dropbox folder. This is so that a user doesn't have to rebuild their own custom creatures when using MoFlow on different devices.
* Support for more expressive die expressions
	* Currently, the die evaluator can only process simple die expression, the most complex being something like 4d8+32. Would like it so that the evaluator can process multiple die strings. For example, 3d4+5d12+32, to support multiclass monsters or characters.
